The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger if the user's session is invalidated due to a network issue or other unexpected reasons. This can lead to a situation where the app displays outdated authentication status, potentially causing unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. For example, a user might appear logged in when they are actually not.  The absence of explicit error handling makes it difficult to detect such scenarios.
