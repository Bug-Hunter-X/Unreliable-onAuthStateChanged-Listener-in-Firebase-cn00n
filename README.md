# Unreliable Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the Firebase `onAuthStateChanged` listener where it may fail to update the authentication status reliably when a user's session is invalidated due to network problems or other unforeseen circumstances.  This can lead to security issues and unexpected application behavior.  The solution offers improved error handling and a more robust approach.

## Bug Report
The included `authBug.js` file illustrates the unreliable nature of the listener in scenarios with interrupted connections or session invalidations.  Note the lack of error handling which makes diagnosing such issues challenging.

## Solution
The `authSolution.js` file provides a solution that includes more comprehensive error handling and additional checks to ensure the authentication status is accurately reflected.
